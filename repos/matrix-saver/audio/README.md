# Audio Directory

Place your MP3 files here for the matrix saver.

## Supported files:
- ambient1.mp3
- ambient2.mp3
- ambient3.mp3
- ambient4.mp3
- ambient5.mp3
- (add as many as you want)

## How it works:
1. Files are shuffled randomly on app start
2. Each track plays to completion
3. Next track is selected randomly
4. If MP3 files are missing, synthetic backup audio plays

## Recommendations:
- Use ambient/electronic/drone music
- File sizes should be reasonable for web (under 10MB each)
- Ensure proper MP3 encoding for web compatibility
